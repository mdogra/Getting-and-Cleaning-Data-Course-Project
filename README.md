# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The week 4 project of Getting and Cleaning data exhibits cleaning of a tidy data set which can be used for further analysis.

Please make sure to change the working directory before running the script

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
